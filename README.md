# Certifice Kubernets Security Specialist (CKS) Bookmarks

[This is a list](cks-bookmarks.html) of bookmarks to import into Chrome that you could use as a starting point for your own list of bookmarks to be used during the actual test. While taking the CKS test you may access specific documentation websites.

>PLEASE NOTE: Over time, the requirements of the exam will change, so these bookmarks may be out of date, incorrect, or possibly even break the test agreement. (There are only a handful of websites you are allowed to visit during your test.) Use these at your own risk and double check all the links that are not part of the official Kubernetes docs. There are links to Falco, Apparmor, Sysdig, Trivy, etc, that may need to be removed or updated.
